""" your boss comes to yu and tells you that we need to hire one more person in the team,
and he wants to know from you how much of your bandwidth that it will take,
in hours/week.

You ask him, when do you need them hired by? and how confident do you need me to be?
He responds -- aaah, 6 months and 98% confident

you worked out an equation that relates the effort E (hrs/week)
to the time to hire T (weeks) and confidence P. You defined several parameters as assumptions

E = (xi*ei)/(T-th)*log(1-P)/log(1-x)

xi = # of interviews / # of CVs
x = # of hires / # of CVs
th = time in weeks to convert one CV to a hire
ei = effort for a single interview in hrs
